Description: Metabolomics and spectral data analysis and mining. A R package 
	that provides a set of methods for metabolomics data analysis, including 
	data loading in different formats, pre-processing, metabolite 
	identification, univariate and multivariate data analysis, machine 
	learning and feature selection. The implemented methods provide adequate 
	support for the analysis of data from diverse experimental techniques, 
	integrating a large set of functions from several R packages in a 
	powerful, yet simple to use environment. In order to install the package, 
	the packages from BioConductor (xcms, MAIT, genefilter, impute, mzR) and 
	mzmatch.R from http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/installation.php must be 
	installed. Also, case studies can be found on the website: http://darwin.di.uminho.pt/metabolomics
