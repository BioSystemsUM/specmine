\title{
Perform feature selection
}
\description{
  Perform feature selection on the dataset.
}
\usage{
feature_selection(dataset, column.class, method = "rfe", 
functions, validation = "cv", repeats = 5, number = 10, 
subsets = 2^(2:4))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dataset}{
    list representing the dataset from a metabolomics experiment.
}
  \item{column.class}{
    string or index indicating what metadata to use.
}
  \item{method}{
    method used for feature selection. Possible values are "rfe" (recursive feature elimination) and "filter" (Selection by filter - sbf) from caret's package.
}
  \item{functions}{
    a list of functions for model fitting, prediction and variable importance/filtering.
}
  \item{validation}{
    the external resampling method: boot, cv, LOOCV or LGOCV (for repeated training/test splits.
}
  \item{repeats}{
    for repeated k-fold cross-validation only: the number of complete sets of folds to compute.
}
  \item{number}{
    either the number of folds or number of resampling iterations.
}
  \item{subsets}{
    a numeric vector of integers corresponding to the number of features that should be retained (rfe only).
}
}

\value{
  caret's result from rfe or sbf.
}
