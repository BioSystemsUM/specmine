\title{
Perform recursive feature elimination
}
\description{
Perform recursive feature elimination on the dataset using caret's package.
}
\usage{
recursive_feature_elimination(datamat, samples.class, 
functions = caret::rfFuncs, method = "cv", repeats = 5, 
number = 10, subsets = 2^(2:4))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{datamat}{
    data matrix from dataset.
}
  \item{samples.class}{
    string or index indicating what metadata to use.
}
  \item{functions}{
    a list of functions for model fitting, prediction and variable importance.
}
  \item{method}{
    the external resampling method: boot, cv, LOOCV or LGOCV (for repeated training/test splits.
}
  \item{repeats}{
    for repeated k-fold cross-validation only: the number of complete sets of folds to compute.
}
  \item{number}{
    either the number of folds or number of resampling iterations.
}
  \item{subsets}{
    a numeric vector of integers corresponding to the number of features that should be retained.
}
}

\value{
A caret's rfe object with the result of recursive feature selection.
